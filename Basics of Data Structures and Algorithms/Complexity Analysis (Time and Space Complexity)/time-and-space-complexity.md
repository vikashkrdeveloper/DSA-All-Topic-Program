# Time Complexity of Algorithms in Data Structures

Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It is denoted by the big O notation.

The time complexity of an algorithm is usually expressed in terms of the input size, n. It represents the number of basic operations performed by the algorithm as a function of the input size.

The time complexity of an algorithm is used to analyze the performance of the algorithm and compare it with other algorithms based on the time taken to execute the algorithm.

The time complexity of an algorithm is classified into different categories based on the number of basic operations performed by the algorithm as a function of the input size.

The time complexity of an algorithm is classified into the following categories:

1. Constant Time Complexity (O(1))
2. Logarithmic Time Complexity (O(log n))
3. Linear Time Complexity (O(n))
4. Linearithmic Time Complexity (O(n log n))
5. Quadratic Time Complexity (O(n^2))
6. Cubic Time Complexity (O(n^3))
7. Exponential Time Complexity (O(2^n))
8. Factorial Time Complexity (O(n!))

These categories represent the growth rate of the time complexity of an algorithm as a function of the input size. They are used to analyze the performance of algorithms and compare them based on their time complexity.

#### How to calculate the time complexity in mathematics? And What is the formula for time complexity?

The time complexity of an algorithm can be calculated using the following formula:

T(n) = O(f(n))

Where:

T(n) = Time taken by the algorithm to run as a function of the input size n.
O = Big O notation representing the upper bound of the time complexity of the algorithm.
f(n) = Function representing the time complexity of the algorithm in terms of the input size n.

#### How to calculate the time complexity of an algorithm using recursive apporach?

Example: Calculate the time complexity of the following recursive algorithm:

```javascript
function fibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return n;
  } else {
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
  }
}
```

Solution:

The time complexity of the recursive algorithm can be calculated using the following formula:

T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1)

Where:

T(n) = Time taken by the algorithm to run as a function of the input size n.
T(n-1) = Time taken by the algorithm to run for n-1.
T(n-2) = Time taken by the algorithm to run for n-2.
O(1) = Constant time taken by the algorithm to perform basic operations.

step 1: T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + O(1)
step 2: T(n-1) = T(n-2) + T(n-3) + O(1)
step 3: T(n-2) = T(n-3) + T(n-4) + O(1)

By substituting the values of T(n-1) and T(n-2) in the equation T(n), we get:

T(n) = (T(n-2) + T(n-3) + O(1)) + (T(n-3) + T(n-4) + O(1)) + O(1)
T(n) = 2T(n-3) + 2T(n-4) + 3O(1)

By continuing this process, we get:

T(n) = kT(n-k) + (k+1)O(1)

Where k is the number of recursive calls made by the algorithm.

step 4: T(n) = nT(0) + (n+1)O(1)
step 5: T(n) = nO(1) + (n+1)O(1)
step 6: T(n) = O(n)

Therefore, the time complexity of the recursive algorithm is O(n).
