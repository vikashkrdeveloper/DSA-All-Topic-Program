#### Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis. These notations describe the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. The three most commonly used asymptotic notations are:

1. Big O Notation (O)
2. Omega Notation (Ω)
3. Theta Notation (Θ)

These notations are used to describe the upper, lower, and tight bounds of a function, respectively. They are used to analyze the performance of algorithms and compare them based on their time complexity. 

#### Big O Notation (O)

Big O notation is used to represent the upper bound of a function. It describes the worst-case scenario of an algorithm, i.e., the maximum time taken by the algorithm to complete its execution. The Big O notation provides an asymptotic upper bound on the growth rate of a function. It is used to analyze the upper limit of the time complexity of an algorithm.

The Big O notation is denoted by O(f(n)), where f(n) is a function that represents the time complexity of an algorithm. It is used to describe the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm in terms of the input size n. The Big O notation provides an upper limit on the growth rate of a function and is used to analyze the worst-case time complexity of an algorithm.

Omega notation is used to represent the lower bound of a function. It describes the best-case scenario of an algorithm, i.e., the minimum time taken by the algorithm to complete its execution. The Omega notation provides an asymptotic lower bound on the growth rate of a function. It is used to analyze the lower limit of the time complexity of an algorithm.

The Theta notation provides an asymptotic tight bound on the growth rate of a function. It is used to analyze the average-case time complexity of an algorithm.
